        	<p style="font-size: 30px">Why this Website?</p>
        	<p style="font-size: 25px">Constructing a resume is a daunting task — if you do it alone. How do you know what to include, how to format your document, what sections to highlight and what to omit? How do you build a document that truly reflects the You that you want to put out into the world? In the space of a page, you have to convey all the components that add up to make you a marketable masterpiece. Where do you even begin?</p>
        	<br>
			<p style="font-size: 25px">The last thing you want is for your resume to let you down when you are actually the most appropriate pick for the job. But even if you are the most qualified person for the job, unless your resume expresses this, nothing is guaranteed.</p>
			<br>
			<p style="font-size: 25px">For starters, it's important to note that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to resume building. The document you create will vary depending on the industry that you are in, the experience you bring to the table, and what parts of your history you want to highlight. There are, however, basic guidelines that are applicable to everyone.</p>
			<br>
			<p style="font-size: 25px">A professional resume builder is the ally you need to take that leap forward in your career that you've been hoping for. Our advanced technology will help you build your resume from one of our exquisite templates so that you feel confident you are putting your best foot forward as you step into the job market.</p>
			<br>
			<p style="font-size: 25px">With over 20 templates that have been custom built for our resume builder website, you are bound to find the perfect match. What's more, our templates have received the HR stamp of approval. That's right we've done our homework to find out exactly what it is companies are looking for, so that you can get that much closer to answering the call that will change your life. Our aim is to be the perfect resume builder for you, regardless of your industry and experience. The combination of our templates and your input will make your resume fly to the top of any pile.</p>
			<br>
			<p style="font-size: 25px">Your resume is no different from a pitch document for a brilliant idea — the only difference being that, in the case of a resume, the bright idea is you. If the people on the other end of the line do not get the idea by the time they get to the bottom of the page, your document has proven unsuccessful.</p>
			<br>
			<p style="font-size: 25px">We don't want this to happen to you. We believe that everyone has the right to an expert resume. That's why we created our resume builder website. We would like to do what we can to transform your opportunities into realities.</p>
